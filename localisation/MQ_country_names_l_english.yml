 forging_of_an_empire: "Forging of an Empire"
 forging_of_an_empire_desc: "The flame of our spirit is hot enough to burn even the mightiest of steel! Under the blessing of our ancestors, we set out to claim even the most unyielding of lands, to render unto our men a new empire - one far greater than any our forefathers might’ve dreamed of possessing."
 eternal_fleet_of_muhammad_qu: "Eternal Fleet of Muhammad ibn Qu"
 eternal_fleet_of_muhammad_qu_desc: "Imbued in the blood of our men is a tenacity for the great and wild sea. Descended from the hardened, weary sailors who survived the brutal voyage from our homeland, our sailors yearn for adventure. They shy not from wicked waves, raving rapids, insipid ills - for they know it would bring no greater dishonour to their ancestors than to fear the water."
 strangers_of_the_trees: "Strangers of the Trees"
 strangers_of_the_trees_desc: "Since we first set foot upon this land, we have been haunted, by nights and by day. Shadows follow us amidst the trees - speaking strange tongues, following stranger gods. In spite of our vast differences, these people, those disparate and meek enough, have offered us barter at times, charity on occasion. Thus, we know well how to cultivate working relationships with their own assorted tribes - posing excellent incentive not only to trade, but to assimilate, too."
 the_word_of_allah: "The Distant Word of Allah"
 the_word_of_allah_desc: "Fear not! Deprived as we are of brethren, of neighbors, allies and rivals alike who live and breathe the wisdom of the Prophet, we hold fast to the memory of his word. We cherish the texts we have retained, uphold the knowledge we have strove to protect - as a result, our faith shines like a beacon in a land of unholy darkness."
 winds_of_trade: "Winds of Trade"
 winds_of_trade_desc: "Situated at a crossroads between antique lands, privy to plants, beasts, spices, treasures and gems, we boast a mercantile potential that is the envy of the whole world. We would be fools not to capitalize."
 fruit_of_the_interior: "Fruit of the Interior, Toil Under the Sun"
 fruit_of_the_interior_desc: "Upon our land, the sun never seems to set. Entire clans have laid down roots to pride themselves on local produce. Fledgling workshops, manufactories, emporiums, depots, now sparkle upon our maps like stars in the sky. Never is there a lull in the passing of grain, fabric, meat, metal, timber - the life blood of our nation beats on, courtesy of our proud hearts."
 defend_from_the_west: "Defend From the West"
 defend_from_the_west_desc: "The great powers of Europe, the colonialist warmongers, would delight to see our nation in ruin, ripe for the taking. We must stand tall and repel any advances they may make, lest we lose our nation and way of life."
